# CS-Project3
This was a project I did with a group for school. It was based off of the classic fifteen puzzle where there are fifteen tiles that are shuffled and the user has to put them in order by sliding the tiles around. For this project, I made the celebration notification alerting the user they won, the move counter, and the timer function. I assisted on the shuffle function.
